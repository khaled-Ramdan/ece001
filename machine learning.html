<h3> what is machine learning</h3>
<center><img src="download (3) (1).jpeg" alt="what is machine learning" width="50%" hight="50%"></center>
<p class="test">Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across. As it is evident from the name, it gives the computer that makes it more similar to humans: The ability to learn. Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one would expect.
</p>
<p class="test">Machine learning is a hot topic in current industry and 
academia. Companies such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook have invested many 
millions of dollars in machine learning to improve their products and services. I 
begin with some fairly simple demonstrations on the Raspberry Pi to examine how a 
computer can “learn” in a primitive or naive sense. First, I would like to acknowledge 
that I drew much inspiration and knowledge for this chapter from Bert van Dam’s book 
Artificial Intelligence: 23 Projects to Bring Your Microcontroller to Life (Elektor Electronics 
Publishing, 2009).Although van Dam did not use a Raspberry Pi as a microcontroller, the 
concepts and techniques he applied are completely valid and especially appreciated.</p>
<h3>How does machine learning works?</h3><center>

<p class="test">The core insight of machine learning is that much of what we recognize as intelligence hinges on probability rather than reason or logic. If you think about it long enough, this makes sense. When we look at a picture of someone, our brains unconsciously estimate how likely it is that we have seen their face before. When we drive to the store, we estimate which route is most likely to get us there the fastest. When we play a board game, we estimate which move is most likely to lead to victory. Recognizing someone, planning a trip, plotting a strategy—each of these tasks demonstrate intelligence. But rather than hinging primarily on our ability to reason abstractly or think grand thoughts, they depend first and foremost on our ability to accurately assess how likely something is. We just don’t always realize that that’s what we’re doing.<br><br>Back in the 1950s, though, McCarthy and his colleagues did realize it. And they understood something else too: Computers should be very good at computing probabilities. Transistors had only just been invented, and had yet to fully supplant vacuum tube technology. But it was clear even then that with enough data, digital computers would be ideal for estimating a given probability. Unfortunately for the first AI researchers, their timing was a bit off. But their intuition was spot on—and much of what we now know as AI is owed to it. When Facebook recognizes your face in a photo, or Amazon Echo understands your question, they’re relying on an insight that is over sixty years old.</p>
<h3>MACHINE LEARNING APPLICATIONS</h3>

<p class="test">Ever since digital computers were invented, linguists and computer scientists have sought to use them to recognize speech and text. Known as natural language processing, or NLP, the field once focused on hardwiring syntax and grammar into code. However, over the past several decades, machine learning has largely surpassed rule-based systems, thanks to everything from support vector machines to hidden markov models to, most recently, deep learning. Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, and Google’s Duplex all rely heavily on deep learning to recognize speech or text, and represent the cutting-edge of the field.
