<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="test">
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the field devoted to constructing artificial animals (or at least artificial creatures which appear to be animals with suitablecontexts) and, for many, artificial persons (or at least artificial creatures which appear to be persons with suitable contexts).Such goals ensure that AI is a discipline of a very considerable interest to many philosophers.This has been confirmed by the energetic attempt, on the part of numerous philosophers, to show that these goals are in fact can't be achieved. Many of the core techniques and formalisms used in AI come out of, and are indeed still much used and refined in, philosophy: first-order logic and its extensions; intensional logics suitable for the modeling of doxastic attitudes and deontic reasoning;probability theory, inductive logic, and probabilistic reasoning; practical reasoning and planning.</p><p class="test">
In the present, the history of AI is briefly recounted, proposed definitions of the field are discussed, and an overview of the field is provided. In addition, both philosophical AI and philosophy of AI are discussed via examples of both.

<h3>what Al exactly means?</h3>

<p class="test">
So far we have been proceeding as if we have a firm and precise grasp of the nature of AI. But what exactly is AI? Philosophers arguably know better than anyone that precisely defining a particular discipline to the satisfaction of all relevant parties (including those working in the discipline itself) can be acutely challenging. Philosophers of science certainly have proposed credible accounts of what constitutes at least the general shape and texture of a given field of science and/or engineering, but what exactly is the agreed-upon definition of physics? What about biology? What, for that matter, is philosophy, exactly? These are remarkably difficult, maybe even eternally unanswerable, questions, especially if the target is a consensus definition. Perhaps the most prudent course we can manage here under obvious space constraints is to present in encapsulated form some proposed definitions of AI. We do include a glimpse of recent attempts to define AI in detailed, rigorous fashion (and we suspect that such attempts will be of interest to philosophers of science, and those interested in this sub-area of philosophy.</p><p class="test">

Russell and Norvig (1995, 2002, 2009), in their aforementioned AIMA text, provide a set of possible answers to the “What is AI?” question that has considerable currency in the field itself. These answers all assume that AI should be defined in terms of its goals: a candidate definition thus has the form “AI is the field that aims at building …” The answers all fall under a quartet of types placed along two dimensions. One dimension is whether the goal is to match human performance, or, instead, ideal rationality. The other dimension is whether the goal is to build systems that reason/think, or rather systems that act. The situation is summed up in this list:
</p>
<ol type="i"class="test1">
<li>Human-Based</li>
<li> Ideal Rationality </li>
<li> Reasoning-Based <ol>
<li>Systems that think like humans.</li>
<li>Systems that think rationally.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Behavior-Based<ol>
<li> Systems that act like humans.</li>
<li> Systems that act rationally.</li>
</ol></li>
