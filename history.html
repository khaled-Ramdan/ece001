<h3>Introduction</h3>
<center><img src="images.png" alt=" history of artificial intilligance"></center>
<p class="test">The term artificial intelligence was first coined by John McCarthy in 1956 when he held the first academic
conference on the subject. But the journey to understand if machines can truly think began much before that. In 
Vannevar Bush’s seminal work As We May Think [Bush45] he proposed a system which amplifies people’s own 
knowledge and understanding. Five years later Alan Turing wrote a paper on the notion of machines being able to 
simulate human beings and the ability to do intelligent things, such as play Chess [Turing50].</p><p class="test">
No one can refute a computer’s ability to process logic. But to many it is unknown if a machine can think. The 
precise definition of think is important because there has been some strong opposition as to whether or not this 
notion is even possible. For example, there is the so-called ‘Chinese room’ argument [Searle80]. Imagine someone 
is locked in a room, where they were passed notes in Chinese. Using an entire library of rules and look-up tables 
they would be able to produce valid responses in Chinese, but would they really ‘understand’ the language? The 
argument is that since computers would always be applying rote fact lookup they could never ‘understand’ a 
subject.</p><p class="test">
This argument has been refuted in numerous ways by researchers, but it does undermine people’s faith in
machines and so-called expert systems in life-critical applications.</p>
<h3> Can Machines Think?</h3><center>

<p class="test"> In the first half of the 20th century, science fiction familiarized the world with the concept of artificially intelligent robots. It began with the “heartless” Tin man from the Wizard of Oz and continued with the humanoid robot that impersonated Maria in Metropolis. By the 1950s, we had a generation of scientists, mathematicians, and philosophers with the concept of artificial intelligence (or AI) culturally assimilated in their minds. One such person was Alan Turing, a young British polymath who explored the mathematical possibility of artificial intelligence. Turing suggested that humans use available information as well as reason in order to solve problems and make decisions, so why can’t machines do the same thing? This was the logical framework of his 1950 paper, Computing Machinery and Intelligence in which he discussed how to build intelligent machines and how to test their intelligence.</p>
<h3>aritificial intilligence is everywhere:</h3>
<p class="test">We now live in the age of “big data,” an age in which we have the capacity to collect huge sums of information too cumbersome for a person to process. The application of artificial intelligence in this regard has already been quite fruitful in several industries such as technology, banking, marketing, and entertainment. We’ve seen that even if algorithms don’t improve much, big data and massive computing simply allow artificial intelligence to learn through brute force. There may be evidence that Moore’s law is slowing down a tad, but the increase in data certainly hasn’t lost any momentum. Breakthroughs in computer science, mathematics, or neuroscience all serve as potential outs through the ceiling of Moore’s Law.</p>
<h3> The future:</h3>

<p class="test">So what is in store for the future? In the immediate future, AI language is looking like the next big thing. In fact, it’s already underway. I can’t remember the last time I called a company and directly spoke with a human. These days, machines are even calling me! One could imagine interacting with an expert system in a fluid conversation, or having a conversation in two different languages being translated in real time. We can also expect to see driverless cars on the road in the next twenty years (and that is conservative). In the long term, the goal is general intelligence, that is a machine that surpasses human cognitive abilities in all tasks. This is along the lines of the sentient robot we are used to seeing in movies. To me, it seems inconceivable that this would be accomplished in the next 50 years. Even if the capability is there, the ethical questions would serve as a strong barrier against fruition. When that time comes (but better even before the time comes), we will need to have a serious conversation about machine policy and ethics (ironically both fundamentally human subjects), but for now, we’ll allow AI to steadily improve and run amok in society.
